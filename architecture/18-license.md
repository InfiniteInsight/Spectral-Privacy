## 18. License Recommendation

**AGPLv3** — ensures that any hosted version of Spectral (e.g., someone wrapping it as a SaaS) must also be open source. This protects the community's work while still allowing personal and commercial use.

**Broker definitions:** CC-BY-SA to encourage sharing while requiring attribution.

**Domain intelligence definitions:** CC-BY-SA, same rationale.
