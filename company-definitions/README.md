# Company Definitions

This directory contains TOML definition files for commercial companies (non-brokers) that users may want to request data deletion from.

## Schema

Company definitions include:
- Company name and domain
- Privacy contact email/URL
- Deletion request method (web form, email template)
- Applicable privacy laws
